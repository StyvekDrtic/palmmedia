    <p class="firstKiddo wow fadeInRight" data-wow-delay="1.0s">This is by far, the biggest project we've worked on. We are completely in charge of all post-production for the On The Rebound podcast, hosted by 5x NBA Champion, fashion icon, world peacemaker and relationship expert Dennis Rodman. That means putting together every episode (audio correction, video, graphics, micro-content for social media, etc.). We also helped his team launch the show on almost every platform like Spotify, iTunes, etc. by handling every necessity connected with it.</p>
    <p class="wow fadeInRight" data-wow-delay="1.0s">To see exactly what we do on the project, we'd highly recommend you to listen to the podcast yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/62plEEwnHJ90PY2WGOGBEh?si=s0RHVfKITly5YPceMu2Gtg">link</a></p>
