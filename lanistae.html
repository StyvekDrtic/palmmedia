    <p class="firstKiddo wow fadeInRight" data-wow-delay="1.0s">This projects took place at the very beginning of the idea to make something like PalmMedia in the future - Q1, 2017. Our goal was to create a platform for personal trainers, of any kind, that are looking for new clients. We made this web app - fully responsive, SEO optimized with a really limited use of any third-party code. That’s because this project wasn’t really meant to make money but to somehow validate our skills as a digital agency. Skills like: Website development, design, UX, marketing, 1 on 1 communication with the trainers themselves or being able to write the "Terms of Use" document.</p>
