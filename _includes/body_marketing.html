Even investing in things that seem to be more modern like Google Ads, it just doesn't make sense for most people. Running ads on social media is something totally different. It's a direct connection between you and your customer, you'll have an unlimited amount of choices to target people based on demographics, interests, etc. + if it's done right, your campaign will grow organically, for free! Just because people really enjoy the content.</p>
