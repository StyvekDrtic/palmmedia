    <p class="wow fadeInRight firstKiddo" data-wow-delay="1.0s">Have you ever thought about having an Alexa skill? Or hosting your own podcast? You might be thinking no one uses it today, or at least not to the extent where it would be beneficial for you to invest. But what we want to do, is to prepare your business for the huge boom of these platforms. Here are some stats: 50% of all searches will be voice searches by 2020 and 55% of every family in the USA will have, at least, one voice-activated device in their house by 2022. Is that convincing?</p>
    <p class="wow fadeInRight" data-wow-delay="1.0s">Right now we mainly focus on 2 things. Podcasting is the first one. We offer you a very detailed guidance that will make it easier for your company to have a successful podcast. We'll help you with the technical part (ways to set up the hardware, post-production, etc.), its deployment (iTunes, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast, etc.), RSS hosting as well as with its promotion. We understand how confusing it has to be for you to take care of everything especially working with a very fast growing medium like this one. The other thing is all about smart speakers. PalmMedia will design, develop and launch skills for Google Home, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Homepod. We believe one day it's going to be essential for every company to care about their presence on these devices.</p>
