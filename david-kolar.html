    <p class="firstKiddo wow fadeInRight" data-wow-delay="1.0s">Having a presence on the internet is an absolute must-have in today’s world. But making your brand actually stand out? That’s the hard part.</p>
    <p class="wow fadeInRight" data-wow-delay="1.0s">David has been already producing a lot of long-form content like webinars or vlogs. But that’s not the kind of content you’d want to share on platforms like Instagram. To solve this problem we came up with a process that transforms his original videos into a micro-content, ready to be shared on social media. It’s really important for us to make those posts feel native to the platform. For example, every video we share needs to have subtitles and a timer attached (for a better user experience). We also make quotes and additional graphics used in various marketing campaigns.</p>
